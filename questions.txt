1. Because I see call to mglGetSID, I type help mglGetSID and find mglSetSID should probably 
be called before mglGetSID

So I try

>> mglSetSID('add');
(mglSetSID) SID database is locked by wei since 15-Feb-2019 21:20:08
Do you want to ignore the lock (in which case if wei tries to save, you might lose your changes - or you might write over their changes) (y/n)? y
(mglSetSID) Stealing lock from wei
(mglSetSID) Setting lock file on SID database
(mglSetSID) !!! Can not load SID Database because filename has not been set: use mglSetParam('sidDatabaseFilename','filename'); !!!
>> mglSetParam('sidDatabaseFilename','filename');
>> mglSetSID('add');
(mglSetSID) Setting lock file on SID database
(mglSetSID) Could not find SID Database file filename, create one from scratch? (y/n)? y
Undefined variable reqiredFields.

Error in mglSetSID>loadSIDDatabase (line 507)
      if iscell(reqiredFields{iField}{2})

Error in mglSetSID>addSID (line 682)

2. What does replay mean?
3. What does overrideRun mean?
4. there is a variable called debug, which is also a MATLAB built-in function. 
5. there is a variable called run, which is also a MATLAB built-in function.

6. What does "probe" task mean?
Seems like setting up task structure, such as what is the first segment, what is second, ... and how long each segment is.

7. The task while-loop that calls updateTask and tickScreen 
what does updateTask do? 
Where is the frame-by-frame drawing? I thought in initTask, but no longer sure because can't find evidence to support it. 
Where is the loop that detects response? 
If you provide feedback based on subject's performance on a trial-by-trial basis, there should be code for it. where is it?
